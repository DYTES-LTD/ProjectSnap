# FakeSnapchatGenerator

FakeSnapchatGenerator is a front-end–only web application designed to let users create a fully customizable chat interface that mimics Snapchat (or any chat-style layout). With FakeSnapchatGenerator, you can generate a realistic chat screenshot by customizing the conversation, participants, and visual elements—all without the need for a backend.

## Project Overview

FakeSnapchatGenerator is designed for creating fake chat screenshots that look like real conversations. The application:
- Displays a default sample conversation on load.
- Allows users to customize chat settings (e.g., direct message header, chat day).
- Lets users add, rename, and modify unlimited participants (e.g., “Me”, “Jack”, etc.) with custom names, colors, and icons.
- Enables users to add messages dynamically, with each message showing a vertical colored bar representing the sender’s identity.
- Provides functionality to capture the final chat view as an image using html2canvas, which can be downloaded directly to the device.

---

## Features

- **Live Default Conversation:**  
  A pre-populated chat appears on the first load with sample messages.
  
- **Chat Settings:**  
  Customize the direct message header and the chat day label.

- **Participant Management:**  
  - Add unlimited participants with unique IDs.
  - Edit each participant’s name, color (for the vertical message indicator), and icon.
  
- **Message Management:**  
  - Select a sender from a dropdown list.
  - Add messages dynamically that display with sender details and a vertical color bar.
  
- **Screenshot Download:**  
  A “Download” button that uses html2canvas to capture the chat preview and save it as a PNG file.
  
- **Custom Visuals:**  
  Optional image upload in messages and customizable chat background to closely mimic Snapchat’s design.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  - React.js – for building the interactive user interface.
  - CSS (or CSS modules/styled-components) – for styling and responsive design.
- **Image Capture:**  
  - html2canvas – for capturing the chat preview as an image.
- **Build Tools:**  
  - Create React App (CRA) – for project setup and development workflow.
- **State Management:**  
  - React hooks (`useState` and `useRef`) – for managing the application state.

## Development Approach

The project is structured into several key components:

- **Chat Settings Component:**  
  For modifying global chat options like the direct message header and chat day.

- **Participants Component:**  
  Manages the list of participants. Each participant can be customized (name, color, icon) and new participants can be added dynamically.

- **Messages Component:**  
  Contains the form to select a sender and add messages to the chat. Messages are dynamically added and rendered in the chat preview.

- **Preview Component:**  
  Renders the chat interface, including a top bar (if applicable) and the conversation with proper styling. Uses a React ref to enable screenshot capture.

- **Download Button:**  
  Implements the screenshot functionality using html2canvas, which converts the chat preview into a downloadable image.

## Architecture & Component Structure

- **App Component:**  
  The root container that manages overall state (chat settings, participants, messages) and renders all sections.

- **Chat Settings Component:**  
  Handles chat-wide options such as the direct message header and chat day label.

- **Participants Component:**  
  - Renders a list of participants with editable fields (name, color, icon).
  - Contains a form to add new participants.

- **Messages Component:**  
  - Provides a dropdown to select the sender and a text input to type new messages.
  - Updates the messages list upon submission.

- **Preview Component:**  
  - Renders the live chat interface showing messages with sender details and a vertical colored bar.
  - Wraps the preview in a container targeted by a React ref for screenshot capture.

- **Download Button:**  
  Triggers the screenshot capture using html2canvas and downloads the generated PNG image.
